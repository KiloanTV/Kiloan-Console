# About

I have a dream: a self-designed system where everyone can build the perfect mixing console/video console/DIY whatever console out of Aluminum Sheet Metal and a bit of the best hoppyist in house fabrication, 3d printing! And that's why I did this project, it's adapted somewhat to my current wishes and needs, but it can be individually adapted and replicated by anyone without breaking the budget.
